  "summary": "The diff shows modifications to Layout.tsx, index.css, frontend-file-summaries.txt, and project_state.json. The Layout.tsx file is truncated, making full verification difficult. The index.css file shows no background-image properties present, and includes solid dark grey background colors via OKLCH variables. The file summaries indicate decorative mountain sunrise elements were removed from Layout. However, due to truncation, complete verification of all requirements is limited.",
