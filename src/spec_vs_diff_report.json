However, several backend features related to task automation and monthly tracking are incomplete or missing.",

      "requirement": "Implement daily and monthly task completion tracking that stores user progress over time",
      "reason": "Backend implements DailyRecord type and taskData map, but monthly aggregation and big reward eligibility tracking for consistent monthly completion is not implemented. The AC specifies at month's end users with consistent completion are identified for big reward eligibility which is absent.",
