REQ-10 (decorative backgrounds) is implemented via CSS classes in index.css. REQ-11 (quote update) is visible in LandingPage.tsx and LoginPage.tsx. REQ-12 (image removal) appears to be completed based on prior project state. REQ-13 (image generation) is referenced via asset paths but the actual generated images are not shown in the diff.",
